    - a simple test that checks proper averages `test_code.py`
    - a small file with example data `pets_data.txt`
    - code for simple statistics using NumPy `code_np.py`
    - `test_functions.py` for testing all functions from `code_np.py`
  * new files:
    - `test_exceptions.py` that contains a "template" for testing unwanted input or behaviors


What should be done?
  * filling the tests from `test_exceptions.py`
  * improving functions from `code_np.py`
  * passing the tests by running `py.test`


How can be verified?
  * checking `code_np.py` with various input that should lead to raising exceptions etc.
