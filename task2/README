What is provided:
  * from the previous part: 
    - a simple test that checks proper averages `test_code.py`
    - a small file with example data `pets_data.txt`
    - code for simple statistics based on data from file without using NumPy `code_nonp.py`
  * new files:
    - `test_functions.py` with some "template" for testing all functions from `code_nonp.py`

What should be done?
  * filling all tests from `test_functions.py`

How can be verified?
  * replacing `code_nonp.py` with the code with bugs and running `py.test`
